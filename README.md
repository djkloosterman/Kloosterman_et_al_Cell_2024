# Kloosterman_et_al

This repository contains the metadata necessary for the analysis of the scRNA-seq, VISIUM and other datasets generated and presented in Kloosterman, D.J., Erbani, J., et al. Cell 2024: _Macrophage mediated myelin-recycling fuels brain cancer malignancy_.

# Downloading the data

All sequencing and -omics data generated in this study is available on GSE266149 (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE266149) 


# Analyzing the data

This repository contains the scripts needed to reproduce the figures from this manuscript that were generated with R. 

We provide scripts to reproduce the figures in the manuscript which were produced when analyzing following datasets:
  - scRNA-seq on sorted CD45-/CD45+ cells (50:50) from primary and recurrent glioblastoma GEMMs with either a PDG-Ink4 or PDG-shp53 background
  - VISIUM 10x samples of primary and recurrent glioblastoma GEMMs with either a PDG-Ink4 or PDG-shp53 background

Important: the standard working directory '~/surfdrive/Code Availability/Kloosterman_et_al/' is used in each script. For convenience it is possible to recontruct the folders. Otherwise, adapt when necessary in each script based on where the downloaded data or signatures are stored.


# Extended figure legends

This repository also contains extended figure legends for the main figures (Kloosterman and Erbani et al - Extended Main Figure Legends.docx). The extended figure legends contain extensive details relevant for complete understanding of the main figures.
